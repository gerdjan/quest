			<h2> 
			Just as any other day you woke up, ate your breakfast, and went to the woods to cut some wood for the fire. Winter was coming 
			so you needed a pretty big stock to survive that. You lived in a little but cosy hut at the edge of a big forest, called the dark woods. 
			You lived there for almost your whole life, and knew the forest very well. </br>
			You walked past the warning sign, as you did everyday. 
			</br>

			You followed the path for a while on your way to your woodcutting spot.
