			You walk on the same path as you did when you heard the man. You think back to what happened that day, 
			it was scary to think about what happened to that man. Getting sucked up by the swamp is one of the worst.... Suddenly 
			someone jumps out of the bushes, you try to grap you axe but it is too late. You feel a very deep pain to the back of your head
			and fall to the ground. Something warm and liquid is pouring out of your head. As you look up you see the stars, and the moon. You 
			see the man from earlier today leaning over you. "I needed food, and because you didn't give me some I will take!"
