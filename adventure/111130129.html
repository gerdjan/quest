					With the stick you help the man, who seems very scared. Who are you? you asked, while you are pulling with all the strength you have.
					How did you and up here? I....I was running from the Riders of Rasdhir! 
					</br> you stopped pulling for a moment, if he was running for them he probably would have done something very wrong.
